This little hack for X turns the spacebar key into another control key when used in combination.
When used alone, it behaves like the ordinary space bar on the key release event.
Especially useful with Emacs.

Prerequisites:
* Install X11 and XTEST development packages. On Debian GNU/Linux derivatives,
  $ sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxtst-dev
* Enable the XRecord module by adding 'Load "record"' to the Module section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf,
e.g.:
    Section "Module"
            Load  "record"
    EndSection

Usage:
* Load Space2Ctrl with "s2cctl start"
* Unload Space2Ctrl with "s2cctl stop"
